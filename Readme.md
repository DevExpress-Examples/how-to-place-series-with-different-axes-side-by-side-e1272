# How to place series with different axes side-by-side


<p>This example demonstrates how series with different <a href="http://devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument6016.htm">Y-axes</a> can be placed <strong>side-by-side</strong>.</p><p>In fact, since XtraCharts v2009 vol 1 version this is done automatically for side-by-side <a href="http://devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument2972.htm">Bar</a>, <a href="http://devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument2985.htm">Range Bar</a> and <a href="http://devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument2984.htm">Gantt</a> series. This means that if, for example, the X-Axis is common for multiple series, and the Y-Axis is different, the series are automatically placed side-by-side.</p>
